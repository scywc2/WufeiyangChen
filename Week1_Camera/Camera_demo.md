# Run fastestdet with your own camera (like laptop camera) on your local machine

![Close Object](../Image/close.png "Close Object") 
For relatively close objects, the camera can identify them accurately, and the robot can make action responses to nearby objects
![Far Object](../Image/far.png "Far Object") 
For objects that are relatively far away, the camera can also identify them accurately. For instance, the car in the picture is quite accurate in dynamic recognition and can identify most distant objects. The robot can predict its own behavior based on distant objects
![People](../Image/people.png "People") 
For people who suddenly appear, the camera can identify them well and prevent the robot from responding promptly to objects that suddenly appear
